# Three Buttons
Add 3 buttons with different text to the screen. Press the third button to show the modal controller

* Buttons should be adaptive, for different text - different width. The indent inside the button from the content 10pt vertically and 14pt horizontally.
* When clicked, the button is animatedly reduced in size. When you release it, the button returns to its original size. The animation should be intermittent, for example, the button returns to its size, and during the animation, press the button again - the animation will go from the current size, without jumps
* Put an icon to the right of the text. Use system imageView in button class, you can't create your own imageView. The distance between the text and the icon is 8pt
* When a modal controller is shown, the buttons must be grayed out. You cannot bind to controller lifecycle methods
